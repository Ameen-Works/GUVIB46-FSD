Database:
    -Is an organized collection of information or data, typically stored
    electronically in a computer system.

MySQL: (Micheal Widenius(Founder)[Daughter 'My'] Structured querying language)
    -Is an opensource relational DB management system.
    RDBMS- Relational database management system.

SQL: Structured querying language.
Prgoramming Language:                        Query language:
    * Procedural                                  * Declarative
    * Line to line execution                      * No need
    * Needs Prgoramming                           * no programming

Complier Design:
    - It has a "parser compiler"- breaks into parts eg: "select name from students where age > 22;"

SQL Commands:
select * from students;
Create TAble students(
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    age int NOT NULL,
    edu TEXT NIT NULL
);

ALTER TAble students ADD id int NOT NULL;// will add items at last

INSERT INTO Students VALUES ('Arshath', 22, 'BE ME',1);
INSERT INTO Students VALUES ('Ameen', 22, 'BE ME',2);
INSERT INTO Students VALUES ('ArShanmeershath', 22, 'BE ME',3);
INSERT INTO Students VALUES ('Irfan', 22, 'BE ME',4);
INSERT INTO Students VALUES ('Thariq', 22, 'BE ME',5);// once altered we need to rewrite table contents

UPDATE Students SET name='Arshath AMeen' where name='Arshath';

select * from Students order by id desc; // wich orders a table by ID, if desc added it order the table by descending

select distinct age from STudents; this will give a non-repetive list of ages.

select COUNT(name), edu from student GROUP BY edu; // which will give the count of edu with count.
// group by must have 1 aggregated funciton to perform.

Joins:
    Which allows to access two or more tables from one place.
        -Inner Joins: Returns dataset that have
         matching values on both tables. (like Intersection)
        -Left Join : Returns all records from the left table and 
        matched record from right table.
        -Right Join : Returns all records from the right table and 
        matched record from left table.
        -Full Join:Returns all records when there is a match 
        in either left or right table. (like Intersection)
Normalization: 
    It is the process of organizing the data in the database.
    it divides the larger table into smaller and links them using relationship
    (Primary Key & Foreign Key).
    Which is used to reduce the redundancy from database table.
        1 NF -Contains atomic value [col must contain single value]
        2 NF -Primary key dependancy + 1NF
        3 NF -2NF + transition dependancy
        4 NF -BCNF (Boyce codd's Normal form) - no multi value dependancy
        5 NF -Satisfies when a table is broken into more pieces + 4NF
